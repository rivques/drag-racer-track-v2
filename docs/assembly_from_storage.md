# Assembly From Storage

This document describes how to assemble the racetrack from its storage configuration.

## Parts

You should have the following subassemblies:

* End cap with attached mainboard, screens, beam-break sensors, etc.
* Start cap with attached motor board, servos, etc.
* Race control board
* 6x 5ftx3/4in PVC pipe
* 3 PVC couplers
* 2x Ethernet cables, one at least 13 feet long
* Some scraps of paper
* a bit of tape

## Assembly

1. Put 3 PVC pipes into the holes in the start cap.
2. Add couplers to those pipes and extend each with another PVC pipe.
3. Put the end cap on the other end of the PVC pipes.
4. Attach the motor RJ-45 port of the mainboard to the motor control board. You can run it through the middle PVC pipe.
5. Attach the controller RJ-45 port of the mainboard to the race controller.
6. Tape the scraps of paper to the servo arms, to act as photointerruptor triggers.
